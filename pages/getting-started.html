                To install CBT, just copy the core CBT.Core.dll and build.props to your <code>CBTGlobalPath</code> and the root build.props to your <code>EnlistmentRoot</code> folder.  More information about the folder structure is below.  It is very important that the root Directory.Build.props
                sets the properties correctly depending on your <a href="#/getting-started#folder-structure" target="_self">folder structure</a>.
            </p>
            <p>If you're using a source control system, you'll want to check in these files.  When updating CBT, you should only need to update the CBT.Core.dll and build.props in the <code>CBTGlobalPath</code>.  We don't plan on needing to update these two files very much so rest easy having them checked in.</p>
            <h2>Download</h2>
            <p>To get the latest stable version of CBT Core, download and unzip the <a href="https://github.com/CommonBuildToolset/CBT.Core/releases">latest released version</a> to your <code>CBTGlobalPath</code>.  On Windows, you'll need to unblock <code>CBT.Core.dll</code> after unzipping it.</p>

            <h1 class="page-header" id="">Converting projects</h1>
            <p>Once CBT is installed in your source code tree, you'll need to enable it in each project.  This is done by importing the <code>Directory.Build.props</code> file in your <code>EnlistmentRoot</code>.</p>
            <h3>Latest version of MSBuild (15.0 and above)</h3>
            <p>As of MSBuild 15.0, this file is <strong>automatically</strong> imported and you do <strong>not need to convert projects</strong>.  Newly created projects using Visual Studio templates will just work out of the box.</p>
            <h3>Older versions of MSBuild (14.0 and below)</h3>
            <p>If you're using an older version of MSBuild, then you must edit the project in a text editor and adding the following import to the top of your project:</p>
            <pre><code class="xml">&lt;Import
  Project="$([MSBuild]::GetDirectoryNameOfFileAbove($(MSBuildThisFileDirectory), Directory.Build.props))\Directory.Build.props"
  /&gt;</code></pre>
            <p>
                This tells MSBuild to traverse up the directory tree looking for a Directory.Build.props file.  If needed, you can have Directory.Build.props files at different levels in your tree but be sure that each Directory.Build.props also imports any parent Directory.Build.props.  The Directory.Build.props in the root folder
                imports CBT and enables all of the functionality.
            </p>
            <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning" id="import-placement">
                <h4>Upgrading to MSBuild 15.0</h4> <p>
                    Since MSBuild 15.0 <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/what-s-new-in-msbuild-15-0#updates">automatically imports</a> <code>Directory.Build.props</code>, you'll need to remove this import from your projects when upgrading to the latest version of MSBuild.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h1 class="page-header" id="folder-structure">Folder structure</h1>
            <p>To get started with CBT for your source code projects, you'll first need to establish a <strong>root</strong> folder.  For source control systems like Git, this would be the root of the repository.  If your source code projects are not source control, this would be some base folder that your set of projects share.</p>
            <p>
                CBT uses three folders which you'll need to in your source code tree.
                <ol>
                    <li><code>EnlistmentRoot</code> The root folder of your source code projects.  In this folder you place the root <code>Directory.Build.props</code> file that is imported by all of your MSBuild projects and is then used to enable CBT.  This MSBuild file tells CBT where the <code>CBTGlobalPath</code> and <code>CBTLocalPath</code> folders are.</li>
                    <li><code>CBTGlobalPath</code> The folder where you place CBT's core components.  This folder contains the core functionality of CBT and only needs to be changed when you update CBT. </li>
                    <li><code>CBTLocalPath</code> The folder where you configure CBT for your needs.  This folder can contain CBT module functionality in the case where you don't want to use a module for whatever reason.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <h2>Example folder structure</h2>
            <p>This is a typical and recommended folder structure for your source code projects and the corresponding CBT folders:</p>
            <pre><code>root/                    &lt;- EnlistmentRoot
├── .build/
│   ├── CBT/             &lt;- CBTGlobalPath
│   |   ├── build.props
│   |   └── CBT.Core.dll
│   └── local/           &lt;- CBTLocalPath
│       └── build.props
├── src/
│   ├── project1/
│   └── project2/
└── Directory.Build.props
</code></pre>
            <p>Of course the <code>CBTGlobalPath</code> folder and <code>CBTLocalPath</code> folder can be anywhere you want them.  The above example is similar to what you might find in a Git repository.</p>
            <h2>No source control</h2>
            <p>CBT will also work in a stand-alone fashion without source control.  This example is for a typical project layout where you have a Visual Studio Solution and a few projects:</p>
            <pre><code>root/                    &lt;- EnlistmentRoot
├── .build/
│   ├── CBT/             &lt;- CBTGlobalPath
│   |   ├── build.props
│   |   └── CBT.Core.dll
│   └── local/           &lt;- CBTLocalPath
│       └── build.props
├── ClassLibrary/
├── ConsoleApplication/
├── UnitTests/
├── WebApplication/
├── Directory.Build.props
└── MyProjects.sln
</code></pre>
            <p>The addition is really just the root <code>Directory.Build.props</code> file along with CBT itself.</p>
