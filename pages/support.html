                        Depending on what project type you want to build, you'll need to include separate modules. In most cases, you should be able to leverage existing packages either from an existing build toolset or packages on NuGet.org. For example, Visual Studio SDK projects can already use packages available on NuGet. We highly recommend that you do the same as this will benefit you and future teams!

                        For project-level assembly references, you can place these in the project directory in a <code class="language-xml" data-lang="xml">packages.config</code> or <code class="language-xml" data-lang="xml">project.json</code>. This allows you to manage packages using the Visual Studio NuGet Package Manager. If your project tree is too big and managing packages at the project-level becomes overwhelming, then you can add a <code class="language-xml" data-lang="xml">$(CBTLocalPath)\GlobalPackages\packages.config</code> which can contain packages for the whole tree. Packages are restored and properties are generated by the CBT.NuGet module so you can add references in your project with paths <code class="language-xml" data-lang="xml">$(NuGetPath_Package_Id)\lib\net45\assembly.dll</code>
